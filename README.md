## Hey

This will contain a short description on how to setup your own project if you want to use Playwright for testing

### Install

First of all we must install the required dependencies

```
    npm install @playwright/test
    npx playwright install
```

In this project i used prettier (this is not required in order to use playwright)

```
    npm install prettier
```
